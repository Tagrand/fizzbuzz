# Pair Programming: Fizzbuzz task #

This is a Test Driven Development, pair programming challenge. Aim of this task was to build a programme called "fizzbuzz" using TDD in rspec. A joint effort between @bpourian and @Tagrand.

The program prints out "fizz" if divisible by 3 and "buzz" if divisible by 5. On top of that it would
have to printout "fizzbuzz" if divisible by both numbers.

This was a great way to practise work in pairs and ease our way into a TDD mindset.
